# Sons of Liberty Website

A simple, static website featuring a photo carousel and album gallery powered by Cloudinary.

## Features

- 🏠 Home page with rotating photo carousel (changes every 5 seconds)
- 📸 Photo albums page with gallery view
- 🔄 Automatic photo sync from Cloudinary
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🎨 Clean, minimal interface

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Cloudinary Credentials

Open `fetch-cloudinary-images.js` and add your Cloudinary credentials:

```javascript
const config = {
  cloud_name: 'ddnebrkpu',  // Already set
  api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
  api_secret: 'YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE'
};
```

**Or** set environment variables (more secure):

```bash
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
```

### 3. Organize Your Photos in Cloudinary

1. Log in to your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Upload photos to the Media Library
3. Organize photos into **folders** (e.g., "summer-2024", "golf-tournament")
4. Each folder becomes an album on your website

### 4. Fetch Photos from Cloudinary

Run the fetch script to generate `images.json`:

```bash
npm run fetch-images
```

This will:
- Connect to your Cloudinary account
- Fetch all images organized by folder
- Generate `images.json` with all image URLs
- Display a summary of albums found

### 5. Test Locally

Open `index.html` in your browser to see:
- Home page with carousel
- Navigation to Photos page
- Album galleries

### 6. Deploy

Commit and push all files to your repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update photos from Cloudinary"
git push
```

## Updating Photos

Whenever you add new photos to Cloudinary:

1. Upload photos to Cloudinary and organize in folders
2. Run: `npm run fetch-images`
3. Commit and push: `git add images.json && git commit -m "Update photos" && git push`

## File Structure

```
SOL/
├── index.html              # Home page with carousel
├── photos.html             # Photo albums page
├── images.json             # Generated photo data (don't edit manually)
├── package.json            # Node.js dependencies
├── fetch-cloudinary-images.js  # Script to sync photos
├── CNAME                   # Domain configuration
└── README.md              # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Static Site**: The website is completely static HTML/CSS/JavaScript
2. **Photo Data**: Photos are stored in `images.json` (generated by the script)
3. **Security**: API credentials are only used locally, never exposed in the website
4. **Organization**: Folders in Cloudinary automatically become albums
5. **Carousel**: Randomly displays images from all albums

## Cloudinary Folder Structure

Example organization in Cloudinary:

```
Media Library/
├── summer-bbq-2024/
│   ├── photo1.jpg
│   ├── photo2.jpg
│   └── photo3.jpg
├── golf-tournament/
│   ├── golf1.jpg
│   └── golf2.jpg
└── holiday-party/
    └── party1.jpg
```

This creates three albums:
- "Summer Bbq 2024" (3 photos)
- "Golf Tournament" (2 photos)
- "Holiday Party" (1 photo)

## Troubleshooting

### No images showing on carousel
- Run `npm run fetch-images` to generate images.json
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify images.json exists and contains image URLs

### "Error fetching images" in console
- Make sure you ran `npm run fetch-images`
- Check that images.json is in the same directory as index.html

### Script fails with API error
- Verify your Cloudinary API key and secret are correct
- Check your Cloudinary account has images uploaded
- Ensure you have internet connection
